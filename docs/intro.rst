Overview
********

EPWave is a free interactive browser-based waveform viewer for design and verification engineers. The primary use cases are:

* Run prototype/example code on EDA Playground and view wave results with EPWave.
* Quickly view waves for simulations that ran in the cloud (private or public).

  * Example: EPWave plugs into existing browser-based regression systems.

EPWave is part of the `EDA Playground <http://www.edaplayground.com>`_ tool suite.
